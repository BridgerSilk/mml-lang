# Installation

Installing MML is rather simple and straightforward.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.5 or later

## Manual Download
1. Go to https://github.com/BridgerSilk/mml-lang.
2. Download the `mml_compiler.py` file from the latest release.
3. Place the file in your project directory.
4. Run the ``mml_compiler.py`` file and enter the name of your .mml file without the file extension (e.g. "index") -> a .html file with the compiled mml syntax will be automatically created within milliseconds.

## Install with NPM (WIP)
> We are currently working on the npm package installation method. It will be available soon.

## VSCode Extension
In order to get proper syntax highlighting and other client features, you need to install the vscode extension.
1. Open the vscode extension browser.
2. Search for the MML Lang Support Extension ``(ID: BridgerSilk.mml-lang-support)``
3. Click the install button and reload your vscode extensions.
